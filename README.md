Wade Road East

We are Bill and Karol DeStein.  After living in Raleigh, North Carolina for ten years, and living in Pleasanton, California for twenty six years, we are moving back to Tennessee.  We have purchased a forty-five acre parcel in Loudon, Tennessee.  The parcel has a few hundred feet of frontage on the Tellico Reservoir and no existing structures.  Weâ€™re planning to build a horse farm with a main house, a guest house, a detached garage, horse barn, and a boat dock.
